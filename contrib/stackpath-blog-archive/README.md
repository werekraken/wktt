# StackPath Blog Archive

These blog posts were written almost exclusively with personal time, but were published to the StackPath blog for greater visibility. Before the bpf hook points posts were published, `blog.stackpath.com` was protected by the StackPath WAF. The WAF prevented `archive.org` from successfully archiving the bpf posts in the wayback machine. I'm archiving the original content for all of my posts to the StackPath blog, including the bpf posts, here.
