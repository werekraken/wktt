1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,210
Let's bring up
our machine.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,750
Another highly desirable skill
is to be able

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:09,930
to access the console
of vagrant managed machines.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,480
This is especially useful
when doing low-level work--

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,270
say, troubleshooting boot issues
or looking into a softlockup.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,000
Alternatively, if your
vagrant managed machine is running a GUI,

7
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:25,570
you can access it
using these same methods.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,660
I've used the GUI
of a vagrant managed machine

9
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:34,660
to access legacy ipmi web portals
requiring ancient java components.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,720
GUI use cases for vagrant
definitely exist.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,480
Similarly to shutdown commands,
the native method for console access

12
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,330
provided by your hypervisor
should still work.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,450
In the case of VirtualBox,
we can simply open the VirtualBox Manager,

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,750
select the appropriate machine, and select
show to bring up the console or GUI.

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,540
This method is especially useful
for machines that are already running.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,780
Let's clean up.
