1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,600
So far, we've configured vagrant by adding
settings to our project Vagrantfile.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,900
Another option is to apply config
to a user-level Vagrantfile

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:17,300
found in your vagrant home--
by default `~/.vagrant.d/`.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,150
Let's start by deleting the `auto_update`
line from our project Vagrantfile.

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,840
As we saw previously, if we
run `vagrant up` with this config,

6
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:33,720
the vagrant-vbguest plugin
will attempt to install guest additions.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,360
Let's change the plugin's
default behavior for our user

8
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,540
to skip
guest additions installation.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,210
To do this, we simply
create a Vagrantfile in our vagrant home,

10
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:55,150
add the basic config structure,
and set `vbguest.auto_update` to `false`--

11
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,300
essentially, the same thing
as we did in our project Vagrantfile.

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,540
Let's bring
our machine up.

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,260
Login and again we can see
no VirtualBox kmods are loaded.

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,780
Time to clean up.
