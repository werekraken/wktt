1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:06,150
VirtualBox guest additions provide
some decidedly advantageous features.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,090
Among these is
VirtualBox synced folders--

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:16,180
a clear step up from rsync synced folders
for many vagrant use cases.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,600
Let's install the
vagrant-vbguest plugin

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:24,480
which will automate installation
of VirtualBox guest additions.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,150
Conveniently, the needed steps are added
to the `vagrant up` process.

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,090
In this case, I'm going to configure
the plugin to upgrade the kernel as needed.

8
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,690
Let's bring
our machine up.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,120
So, why did we need
to allow kernel upgrade?

10
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,420
Installation of
VirtualBox guest additions

11
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:59,510
includes the building
of a handful of kernel modules.

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,180
One of these kmods facilitates
VirtualBox shared folders:

13
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,150
the underlying mechanism
upon which

14
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,000
vagrant's VirtualBox synced folders
are built.

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,300
Since we want to explore
VirtualBox synced folders,

16
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,630
we'll need these kmods
to build successfully.

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,480
The `centos/7` box I'm using,
version `2004.01`,

18
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:26,180
contains a
CentOS 7.8 environment.

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,420
However, the contained yum repo config
currently points to CentOS 7.9 packages--

20
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,270
7.8 has been archived.

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,000
We need version matched
installations

22
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:43,900
of the kernel and kernel-devel rpms
in order to build our kmods.

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,510
A CentOS 7.8 kernel and
7.9 kernel-devel won't do.

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,570
We either need to retrieve
kernel-devel from the 7.8 archives,

25
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:58,600
or upgrade the kernel
to the CentOS 7.9 version.

26
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,600
In this case, the former
gives no advantage,

27
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:07,510
and the latter is easier to accomplish--
hence, `allow_kernel_upgrade: true`.

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,750
Guest additions
are now installed.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,240
Login and we can see
the VirtualBox kmods are loaded.

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,480
Let's clean up.
