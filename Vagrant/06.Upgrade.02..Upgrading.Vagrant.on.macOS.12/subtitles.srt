1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,030
We're back on our macOS 12
baremetal environment.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,270
Let's make sure
the basic system is up-to-date.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,060
It is.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,630
To upgrade vagrant and VirtualBox,
we simply run the same subcommands

5
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,210
we used previously to check
if brew managed installs were up-to-date.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,060
There it goes.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,240
Time for some
basic validation.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,390
And the upgrades
look good.
