1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,450
We saw previously that
our project Vagrantfile

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:06,390
can override settings found
in the box Vagrantfile.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,360
We overrode the default rsync synced
folder and made a VirtualBox synced folder,

4
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:16,120
configured with the same paths,
in its place.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,000
This was possible because settings
configured in the project Vagrantfile

6
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,030
have higher precedence
than those in the box Vagrantfile.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,780
Last time, we introduced
a third Vagrantfile:

8
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,270
the one found
in your vagrant home directory.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,630
I mentioned that settings in this file
apply to all the projects of a user.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,900
The topic of Vagrantfile precedence
is increasing in complexity as we go.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,510
Thankfully, the Vagrantfile page
found in the vagrant documentation

12
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:53,330
includes a comprehensive overview
of this topic.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,090
We can see here that
the box Vagrantfile is loaded first

14
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,390
and, therefore,
has the lowest precedence.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,630
The vagrant home Vagrantfile is next,
followed by the project Vagrantfile.

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,540
There are additional precedence concerns
in multimachine environments

17
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:19,660
or when overriding non-provider specific
configuration from within a provider block--

18
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:21,270
these are out-of-scope
for now.

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,480
Last time, we used our
vagrant home Vagrantfile

20
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,420
to skip guest additions
installation by default.

21
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,330
Let's restore our VirtualBox synced folder
using only our project Vagrantfile.

22
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,870
We'll uncomment the kernel upgrade
and VirtualBox synced folder lines.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,720
Then set `vbguest.auto_update`
to `true`.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,930
Based on what we read
in the documentation about precedence,

25
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:53,930
the `vbguest.auto_update = true`
in our project Vagrantfile

26
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,450
should override the `false` value
in our vagrant home Vagrantfile.

27
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,960
Let's bring up
our machine.

28
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,630
And login.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,330
We can see the VirtualBox kmods are loaded
and the /vagrant directory

30
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:30,480
is of type `vboxsf`--
this is indeed a VirtualBox synced folder.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,480
Time to clean up.

32
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,570
Feel free to revert
the changes made last time

33
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:42,060
to your vagrant home Vagrantfile now--
if you so choose.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Doing so will restore
the vagrant-vbguest default

35
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,630
of automatic installation
of guest additions.
