1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,360
Last time, we setup
the vagrant-vbguest plugin

2
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:07,480
to automate installation
of VirtualBox guest additions.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, we're ready to
add a VirtualBox synced folder.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,270
Let's open our Vagrantfile
and add one.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,240
We'll use the same paths
as the rsync synced folder

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:24,750
configured in the box Vagrantfile,
which we saw previously.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,420
We'll set the type
to `virtualbox` here though.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,150
This is a safe pattern and will simply
override the existing rsync synced folder.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,930
Let's create
an external file.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,450
And bring up
our machine.

11
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,000
We can see that
the file exists in /vagrant.

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,690
Let's modify it
from outside.

13
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,600
This time the modification is present
inside the vm without any extra steps.

14
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,960
Let's make
an internal file.

15
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,120
This file is present on the outside
without any extra steps.

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,210
VirtualBox synced folders require
a bit more setup, but are extremely useful.

17
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,930
Let's clean up.
