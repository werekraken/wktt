1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,270
Here we have an Ubuntu 22.04
baremetal environment

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:09,390
with an outdated
`centos/7` vagrant box.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,360
Let's upgrade it.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,900
Time to verify.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,330
We can see that the new version
is present, as was desired.

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,000
However, it may be surprising to find--
on first encounter--

7
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,210
that the old version
is still here too.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,360
vagrant supports multiple versions
of the same box at the same time.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,060
They can be installed
and used side-by-side.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,180
By default new machines will use
the latest installed version of a box.

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,450
However, by adding version constraints
in Vagrantfile

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,780
new machines can be configured
to use an older version.

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,720
In most cases
older versions aren't needed

14
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:02,900
and removing them frees up
precious storage resources.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,450
A simple `vagrant box prune`
will clean things up nicely.

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,480
Verify again and we can see
that the old box is now gone.
