00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,000
Last time, we looked at
using VirtualBox Manager

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:07,060
to access the console
of a vagrant managed machine.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,210
If instead you need frequent access
to the console or GUI, it can be helpful

4
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:16,510
to instantiate a console window
whenever the machine is brought up.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,330
Let's open our Vagrantfile and set `gui`
to `true` for our VirtualBox provider.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,150
Now whenever we bring our machine up,
a console window is simultaneously created.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,720
Our machine is now booted, but vagrant
is still configuring the environment--

8
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,090
let's let it finish.

9
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,120
`vagrant up` is nearly done.
And let's login.

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,210
Time to clean up.

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,120
The console window is automatically
closed out during destruction.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,510
I'm going to remove `gui = true`
to reduce graphical clutter,

13
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,780
but feel free to skip or delay
this step as you see fit.
