1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,450
Another interesting GUI tool,

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:06,690
especially when using vagrant frequently,
is Vagrant Manager.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,570
Per the project README, "Vagrant Manager
is a Windows status bar menu app that lets

4
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:17,420
you manage all of your vagrant machines
from one central location."

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,390
Vagrant Manager is also
available for macOS.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,270
However, unfortunately, Vagrant Manager
isn't available on Linux distros,

7
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,150
like Ubuntu,
at present.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,150
We're back on our Windows 10
baremetal environment

9
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:42,150
with the PSWindowsUpdate PowerShell module,
VirtualBox, and vagrant installed.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Vagrant Manager requires the `vagrant`
command to be in your `$env:PATH`--

11
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:56,510
we just verified that this need is met
with our version check.

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,690
Next, we want to ensure
that our environment is up-to-date.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,450
The basic environment is.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,870
If updates are needed, they can
be installed with a few extra flags.

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,390
Be sure to only use the `-AutoReboot` flag
if now is a suitable time for a reboot.

16
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,450
With our system updated,
we're ready to install Vagrant Manager.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,510
Let's download the Vagrant Manager
setup executable from the latest release.

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,210
Unfortunately, this project doesn't provide
us with the means to validate our download--

19
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,450
no checksums or similar
are included.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,060
However, hope is not lost.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,090
Chocolatey is a well-known
package manager

22
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:52,600
facilitating automated software
installations on Windows.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,840
This package manager itself
is out-of-scope for now,

24
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:01,810
but that doesn't mean we can harvest
some useful information from the project.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,510
The Chocolatey install PowerShell script
for Vagrant Manager

26
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:12,420
includes a SHA-256 of the same setup `.exe`
we just downloaded.

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,600
Verifying that our download
has the same SHA-256

28
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,600
reduces our chances of unnoticed
file corruption or tampering.

29
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,390
For basic validation of an asset securely
downloaded from a trusted domain--

30
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:33,450
such as this--I'm comfortable
with a simple visual comparison.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
I generally compare
the first and last 4-6 characters,

32
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,420
then check one or two random spots
in the middle.

33
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,150
Compare the hashes programmatically
as you see fit.

34
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,360
This download looks good to me.

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,810
Research Vagrant Manager and Chocolatey
as needed and move forward if you so choose.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,660
The Chocolatey PowerShell script
also gives us

37
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:05,390
the arguments needed
to have a silent, promptless install.

38
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,270
Let's install Vagrant Manager by running
the setup `.exe` with these arguments.

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,270
This will both install
and open Vagrant Manager--

40
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,150
which can take
several seconds.

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,870
To access Vagrant Manager
once it's running,

42
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,240
click the newly introduced
"V" icon

43
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:31,210
in the notification area
at the right end of the Windows taskbar.

44
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,180
Our install looks good.

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,540
To finalize initial setup,
there's one more step--

46
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:44,090
and we're only prompted the second time
we open Vagrant Manager on Windows.

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,540
Let's exit and wait
for the "V" icon to disappear.

48
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,810
Then reopen Vagrant Manager--
I'm going to do so via PowerShell,

49
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,450
but using the Start menu
will work just as well.

50
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,330
On second open,
we're immediately met

51
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:06,780
with a Vagrant Manager prompt
about automatic updates.

52
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,150
I'm going to decline for now,
but feel free to accept as you see fit.

53
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,270
And we're done.
