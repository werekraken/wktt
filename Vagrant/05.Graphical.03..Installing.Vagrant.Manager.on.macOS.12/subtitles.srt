1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:003,150
Another interesting GUI tool,

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,870
especially when using vagrant frequently,
is Vagrant Manager.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,750
Per the project README, "Vagrant Manager
is an OS X status bar menu app that lets

4
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:17,930
you manage all of your vagrant machines
from one central location."

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,390
We can see
at the very top of `README.md`

6
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,090
that there's also
a Vagrant Manager for Windows.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,960
However, unfortunately, Vagrant Manager
isn't available on Linux distros,

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,780
like Ubuntu,
at present.

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,720
We're back on our macOS 12.6.3
baremetal environment

10
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,120
with Homebrew, VirtualBox,
and vagrant installed.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,300
Vagrant Manager requires the `VBoxManage`
and `vagrant` commands to be in your `$PATH`--

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,750
we just verified that this need is met
with our version checks.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,690
Next, we want to ensure
that our environment is up-to-date.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,930
The basic environment is.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,300
Let's check Homebrew.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,270
brew managed installs, including vagrant
and VirtualBox, are up-to-date too.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,960
Let's install Vagrant Manager.

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,570
Time to validate our install.

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,900
Open Launchpad and select
Vagrant Manager.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Right away, we're met with one flavor
of macOS Gatekeeper prompt.

21
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,270
Per the Gatekeeper documentation,
"When a user downloads and opens an app,

22
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,150
a plug-in, or an installer package
from outside the App Store,

23
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,030
Gatekeeper verifies that the software
is from an identified developer,

24
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,660
is notarized by Apple to be free
of known malicious content,

25
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:58,120
and hasnâ€™t been altered."

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,870
That all sounds great.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,630
However, the Apple Developer Program
membership

28
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:07,000
required for their services
isn't free.

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,810
And, like many open source projects,
Vagrant Manager doesn't meet these standards.

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,330
Thankfully, `brew install` will have
already programmatically validated

31
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:24,240
our Vagrant Manager download using
the SHA-256 included in the cask.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,030
Research Vagrant Manager and Homebrew as
needed and move forward if you so choose.

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,330
To move forward, select "Show in Finder",
right click the Vagrant Manager icon,


34
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:44,360
select "Open" from the menu, and click
"Open" again on the Gatekeeper prompt.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,540
Doing so will automatically add a security
settings exception for Vagrant Manager.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,060
Next time we open it,
we won't have to repeat this process.

37
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,690
Vagrant Manager itself is now prompting
about automatic updates.

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,810
I'm going to decline for now,
but feel free to accept as you see fit.

39
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,570
To access Vagrant Manager
now that it's running,

40
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,000
click the newly introduced
"V" icon

41
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,060
in the upper right section
of the macOS status bar.

42
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,660
Our install looks good.
