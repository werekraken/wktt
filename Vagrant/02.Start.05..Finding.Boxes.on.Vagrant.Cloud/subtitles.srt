1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,180
Even a cursory look at the vagrant
documentation has a good chance of

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:12,150
uncovering vagrant cloud: the main, public
and searchable, index of vagrant boxes.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,060
We're already aware of the centos/7 box--
let's search for `rockylinux`.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,180
As mentioned previously,
vagrant supports a number of providers.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,390
To use a listed box
it must be available on your provider.

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,540
We can see a provider filter menu
just below the search bar.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,360
And provider badges
in the second column of each listing.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,720
These tools will help keep us informed
as we discover boxes.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,600
Let's drill into the first entry,
`rockylinux/8`.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,480
Right away, we're presented
with a simple Vagrantfile.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,000
Switching to the "New" tab, we can see
the same info in `vagrant init` form.

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,750
Both of these were covered previously
and should look mostly familiar.

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,060
Another thing on this page worth noting

14
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:13,450
is that this box
is externally hosted by dl.rockylinux.org.

15
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,360
This box is created and maintained
by the rocky linux project--

16
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:23,420
the same group already relied upon
by using the rocky linux distro.

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,840
Trusting distro boxes when already
using distro packages sounds reasonable.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,180
It's also worth mentioning, however, that
there are officially endorsed box sets--

19
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:41,210
specifically, those found
in the hashicorp or bento namespaces.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,570
vagrant itself is created
and maintained by HashiCorp.

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,150
Trusting HashiCorp boxes when already
using vagrant seems sensible.

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,570
The bento project is both
part of the well-known

23
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:03,300
chef automation software testing kit
and officially endosed by HashiCorp.

24
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,540
It contains high-quality,
open-source code

25
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,570
to produce many boxes
across several providers.

26
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,480
Back at our search results, we can see
`bento/rockylinux-8` as the third listing.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,660
This box would
be another sound choice.

28
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,390
Now, we know three easy ways to find
credible boxes: seek out distro boxes,

29
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:34,480
boxes in the hashicorp namespace,
or boxes in the bento namespace.

30
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,180
vagrant cloud can also be searched
via command line

31
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,240
by using `vagrant cloud search`.

32
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,030
We can see that this information
is very nearly the same

33
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:49,510
as what's found
in the web portal.

34
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,510
It's even paginated
in a similar way.

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,150
Feel free to dig in more now with `vagrant
cloud search --help` if interested.

36
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,900
Searching for boxes via the web portal
has already become a habit for me,

37
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,000
so I'll end here.
