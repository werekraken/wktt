## Transcript

Adding a Vagrantfile, some provisioners, and few scripts to a project can dramatically improve the development workflow. Formalizing the environment in which development builds and tests take place provides much needed consistency--and vagrant makes doing so easy.

With the vagrant basics we just walked through, you should be ready to begin using vagrant in your own projects. As you might expect, vagrant has many features we didn't cover here. However, the topics covered should provide a good foundational understanding upon which you can build.

Also, don't be afraid to use vagrant to simplify the creation, use, and clean up of ad hoc environments. Inside a vagrant managed machine, you can calmly run that risky command that may damage the environment. More importantly, you get to examine the results and learn something. Then, you can blow that vm away and create a fresh one in its place in almost no time.
