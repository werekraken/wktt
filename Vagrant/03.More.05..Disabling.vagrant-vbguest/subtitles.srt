1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,510
When installed, the vagrant-vbguest
plugin will attempt

2
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:09,240
to install VirtualBox guest additions into
any environment in which they are absent.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,420
While this is generally useful,
there are times when you simply don't need,

4
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:17,300
or even actively don't want,
guest additions.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,630
Skipping guest additions can save you
a lot of time for certain use cases

6
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:26,060
and can bypass a bad exit
from `vagrant up` in others.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,330
It's good to know how to disable
this feature when needed.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,900
Let's edit
our Vagrantfile.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,570
We'll comment out our VirtualBox synced
folder and allow kernel upgrade lines.

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,090
And finally, set
`vbguest.auto_update` to `false`.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,630
Let's bring
our machine up.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,060
Login and we can see
no VirtualBox kmods are loaded.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,930
Time to clean up.
