00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,120
We're back on our Windows 10
baremetal environment.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,960
Let's make sure
the basic system is up-to-date.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
It is.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,360
If updates are needed, they can
be installed with a few extra flags.

5
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,600
Be sure to only use the `-AutoReboot` flag
if now is a suitable time for a reboot.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,540
Let's check winget.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
We can see there are
a few upgrades available,

8
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,000
including vagrant
and VirtualBox.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,030
Let's install these.

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,330
Time for some
validation.

11
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,720
The upgrades
look good.
