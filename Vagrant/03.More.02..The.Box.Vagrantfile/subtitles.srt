Last time, we looked at the default
rsync synced folder for our `centos/7` box.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,240
So, where did this synced folder
come from--where is it configured?

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,720
vagrant boxes actually
ship with a Vagrantfile

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,360
containing some box-level
default configuration.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,180
Let's take a look at the Vagrantfile that
came with the `centos/7` box I'm using,

6
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:27,900
version `2004.01`.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Here we can see
the rsync synced folder config

8
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,780
mapping our project root
to /vagrant.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,660
It's as simple
as that.
