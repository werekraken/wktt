Hey guys. Werekraken here. Welcome to the channel.

Today we'll be talking about vagrant--an awesome tool which makes the creation, use, and clean up of development environments, generally in the form of virtual machines, simple and repeatable.

But first, ladies, gentlemen: I don't care if you prefer linux or unix, like and subscribe. And don't forget to comment.

So, here we are for my first video series. I wanted to kick things off with vagrant fundamentals since I use this tool nearly every day in my work as a computing professional.

One of vagrant's strongest features is that it provides a clean, well-known starting environment that others can reproduce. In this series, we'll explore the foundational knowledge to use vagrant in this way.

The content is primarily targeted at established or aspiring computing professionals and hobbyists. I assume the viewer has basic command line proficiency and won't be stopping to describe every command.

Visit the project website, vagrantup.com, and nearly the first thing you'll see is "Development environments simplified."--the vagrant project really delivers on this claim.

vagrant makes creating a virtual machine to research a question, work out a procedure, or develop code against more accessible than ever before. The machines are defined in a Vagrantfile: plain-text ruby code suitable to be added to source control management. Adding a Vagrantfile to your project let's you formalize a development, build, or test environment that can be passed along, right with the code.

We'll look at installation of vagrant on several baremetal environments. Feel free to watch just the videos matching your baremetal environment--the install videos are structured to include the same general information about vagrant, so you won't miss any fundamentals by doing so.

If you're unsure where you might use vagrant, watch the installation on Ubuntu. This should provide a reasonable general understanding of the process, in addition to covering this specific environment. And it's both the shortest installation procedure and the least encumbered with extra steps.

If you have a different starting environment, head over to the vagrantup downloads page and select the appropriate tab to get specific guidance on your environment.
