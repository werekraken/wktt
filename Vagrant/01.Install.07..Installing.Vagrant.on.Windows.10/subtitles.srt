1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,360
Here we have Windows 10 with the
PSWindowsUpdate PowerShell module

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,780
and winget installed.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,660
First, we want to ensure
that our environment is up-to-date.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,690
The basic environment is.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,690
If updates are needed, they can
be installed with a few extra flags.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,300
Be sure to only use the `-AutoReboot` flag
if now is a suitable time for a reboot.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,020
Let's check winget.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,050
If you have a fresh install
of winget, as I do,

9
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:37,260
you should see an agreement prompt
for the msstore source.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,110
Follow the link to read the terms
and agree if you so choose.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,750
winget managed installs
are up-to-date too.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,780
If winget upgrades are needed,
they can be install with the `--all` flag.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,650
Our goal here is to
install vagrant and VirtualBox.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,020
To do so, we first need to install
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable--

15
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,320
a dependency of VirtualBox.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,200
Now, we can install VirtualBox.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,290
Let's do some basic validation.

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,560
VirtualBox looks good.

19
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,260
Next, let's install vagrant.

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,740
VirtualBox is a well-known,
cross-platform hypervisor

21
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:48,290
and provides a virtualization platform
upon which vagrant can run machines.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,110
vagrant calls the virtualization platforms
it can use providers.

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,020
VirtualBox happens to be
vagrant's default provider

24
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,900
making it arguably
the easiest way to get started.

25
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,960
vagrant supports
several other providers,

26
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:20,620
either natively
or through installable plugins.

27
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,200
Time for some more
basic validation.

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,140
vagrant looks good too.
