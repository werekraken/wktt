1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,120
Here we have macOS 12.6.3
with Homebrew installed.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,240
First, we want to ensure
that our environment is up-to-date.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,840
The basic environment is.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,180
Let's check Homebrew.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,840
brew managed installs
are up-to-date too.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,090
Let's install vagrant
and VirtualBox.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,630
VirtualBox is a well-known,
cross-platform hypervisor

8
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,840
and provides a virtualization platform
upon which vagrant can run machines.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,720
vagrant calls the virtualization platforms
it can use providers.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,780
VirtualBox happens to be
vagrant's default provider

11
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:53,690
making it arguably
the easiest way to get started.

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,300
vagrant supports
several other providers,

13
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:01,840
either natively
or through installable plugins.

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,720
Time for basic validation.

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,600
And the install looks good.
