00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,540
Here we have a
fresh install of Ubuntu 22.04.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,360
Our first step is to ensure
that the environment is up-to-date.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,090
It is. Let's
install vagrant and VirtualBox.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,000
VirtualBox is a well-known,
cross-platform hypervisor

5
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:28,300
and provides a virtualization platform
upon which vagrant can run machines.

6
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,180
vagrant calls the virtualization platforms
it can use providers.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,120
VirtualBox happens to be
vagrant's default provider

8
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:45,780
making it arguably
the easiest way to get started.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,180
vagrant supports
several other providers,

10
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,720
either natively
or through installable plugins.

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,180
Time for some basic validation.

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,660
And the installation looks good.
