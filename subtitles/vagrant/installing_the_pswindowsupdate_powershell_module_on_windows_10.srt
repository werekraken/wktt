1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,510
Here we have
a fresh install of Windows 10.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,660
Let's install
the PSWindowsUpdate module.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,930
With it we can manage updates
from within PowerShell.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,600
PowerShell Gallery is the
central repository for PowerShell code.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,540
This includes both
code projects from Microsoft

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,690
and from the greater
PowerShell community.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,360
Research PSWindowsUpdate
and PSGallery as needed

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,810
and agree to
the prompt if you so choose.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,240
My current environment is
Windows 10 Home Edition

10
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:37,330
where the default execution policy
is `Restricted`.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,120
This prevents scripts,
which we now need, from running.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,900
I'm going to set my execution policy
to `RemoteSigned`,

13
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:48,870
the default for Windows Server.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,210
Check that you also have an execution
policy which allows scripts to run--

15
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,000
preferably the least permissive policy
suitable for your environment.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,900
You can follow the link in the prompt for
more information on execution policies.

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,030
Now, we can import the module.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,210
Let's ensure that
our environment is up-to-date.

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,060
It is.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,510
If updates are needed, they can
be installed with a few extra flags.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,330
Be sure to only use the `-AutoReboot` flag
if now is a suitable time for a reboot.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,900
And we're done.
