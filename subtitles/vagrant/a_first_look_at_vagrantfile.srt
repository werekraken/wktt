1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,360
We're back in our demo directory
with our centos/7 Vagrantfile.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,330
The Vagrantfile produced by `vagrant init`
comes with a lot of comments.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,090
I personally don't like
to keep these around

4
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:17,600
and prefer to avoid adding
clutter of this sort to source control.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm going to remove the comments,

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,420
but feel free to skip or delay this step
to take a peek at them.

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,150
Let's take a look
at our remaining Vagrantfile.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,240
It's pretty simple ruby code
at the moment--

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,120
little more than
setting the box to `centos/7`.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,210
And we supplied that as an
argument to `vagrant init` last time.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,600
Let's make some edits.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to install vim to do so,
but feel free to use any editor you like.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,720
Let's add some additional cpu
and memory resources.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,180
And save that.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,180
Start our machine.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,300
Login.

17
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,570
We can see our cpu count
matches what we set.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,450
As does our memory--
more or less.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,600
We can get a more accurate value
with a less common command.

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,240
The total online memory exactly matches
the value we set in Vagrantfile.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,030
Time to clean up.
