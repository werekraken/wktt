1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:07,060
Here we have macOS 12.6.3 with the
command line developer tools installed.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,660
First, we want to ensure
that our environment is up-to-date.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,600
The basic environment is.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,540
Let's install Homebrew, which is
quite accurately described as

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,840
"The Missing
Package Manager for macOS."

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,180
The simple installation instructions
over at https://brew.sh

7
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:32,120
suggest running bash on the output
of a curl to a well-known github domain.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,720
Even though
I have reasonable confidence

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,390
that the code
and platforms involved are legitimate,

10
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:39,660
I won't use this.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,090
First, the download
isn't validated.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,840
Second, there isn't a reliable
way to audit what actually ran.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,300
Instead, I'll clone
the Homebrew install project--

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,720
the git checkout process will both
ensure the integrity of install.sh

15
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:02,240
and place it on-disk,
permitting future examination if desired.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,390
And now I'll run it.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,600
Homebrew makes it easy to install
many tools not included with macOS.

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,540
A thriving community
which maintains

19
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,600
thousands of package definitions
covers most common needs.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,060
Package definitions come in two forms,
providing quite a bit of flexibility.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,210
A formula builds and
installs an upstream source project.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,780
A cask installs a project's
pre-built application binaries.

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,630
Nowadays, both types are
accessible using `brew install`.

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,480
Homebrew simply makes
life on macOS easier

25
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,900
and is well worth the install.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,420
Let's check our installation.

27
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,210
And looks good.
