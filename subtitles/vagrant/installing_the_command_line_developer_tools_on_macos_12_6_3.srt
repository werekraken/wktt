00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,630
Here we have a
fresh install of macOS 12.6.3.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,360
First, we want to ensure
that our environment is up-to-date.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,330
The basic environment is.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,330
Let's install
the command line developer tools.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,060
Click the install button
on the gui prompt to move forward.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,720
Read the license agreement
and click agree if you so choose.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,480
Now the command line developer tools,
part of Apple's Xcode IDE, are installing.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,600
The command line developer tools contain
many useful executables, including git.

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,710
In addition to the value
it provides directly,

10
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:45,630
git is also needed to install Homebrew
and run installs with Homebrew.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,540
git can also
be installed via Homebrew,

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,120
but we need git
in order to install Homebrew.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,060
This approach isn't going to work--
at least not at this stage.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,750
Of course, we can always
build git from source.

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,840
Doing so requires we
have the needed build toolchain.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,660
An easy way to get that is to install
the command line developer tools.

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,420
Notice a pattern here--
when using macOS,

18
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,870
you'll likely want to install
the command line developer tools.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,600
Let's validate our install.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,870
And more importantly, let's validate
one of the installed executables.

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,660
Looks good.
